This package mostly started as a joke, and from the desire of adding some extra and funny formatting features to Ryver, without requiring administrator rights or any access to the server.
This is done by either installing [AwesomeRyver.user.script](AwesomeRyver.user.script) with [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) for the web version, or by script injection with this Python package for the desktop version.
